### Preston's Neovim Config
This neovim config is meant to be placed into your neovim configuration folder, and it's all of the packages you would need to be me.
This repo's goal is purely just to help me manage my config, and transfer it accross computers easily. 
It most likely won't help outsiders too much, but anyone is free to do whatever they want with it.
